            <p>I help brands turn complex retail data into clear, actionable stories.</p>

            <p>I'm a Sales Insights Manager at Harvest Group, partnering with Kroger-focused CPG brands to uncover what truly drives their business—shopper behavior, category dynamics, digital performance, and emerging retail trends. My background spans insights, category strategy, negotiation, and analytics across Kroger, Bob Evans Farms, and multiple CPG channels.</p>

            <p>I'm currently earning my MBA at Xavier University, where I'm concentrating on data-driven decision-making, predictive analytics, and AI-enabled workflows. My work increasingly focuses on building AI-native insight systems that scale better thinking, not just faster reporting.</p>

            <p>At my best, I'm combining storytelling, data fluency, and creativity to help teams see what really matters, make smarter decisions, and move with confidence.</p>
